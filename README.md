# 9gag
A 9GAG Scraper as a 2 hour challenge.

This will be the log of the work as I move forward. I started this at 15.45 on May 31st.

# LOG

### 17:05 - 17:45
1. Algorithm to scroll is proving much more difficult than anticipated. Stll stuck on it.

### 16:38 - 17:05
1. Decided to focus on retrieving only 1 post and the increase complecity by adding a scrolling algorithm.
2. Saving succesfully one scroll from 9GAG. Missing scroll logic and more data from post. Will add in what is left of time.

### 16:10 - 16:38
1. Params file and config file done. Got stuck with absolute paths.
2. First webdriver working and loading website. Now will start working on algorithm to scroll and capture data.

### 15:52 - 16:10
1. Finished first fixture
2. Package built and running.
3. Test cases done.

### 15:45 - 15:52
1. I will focus on deliver on the assignment by doing the whole process first without much
detail and the add detail as I move forward. To manage to get to the objective and build on that.
2. With that in mind, I will build this as a python package with test cases and config variables
from a YAML file. Will output to JSON and will save initially only title and link post to the 9gag post.
3. Then I will focus on adding more scraping data.
4. Folder and project structure created.
