# 9gag
A 9GAG Scraper as a 2 hour challenge.

This will be the log of the work as I move forward. I started this at 15.45 on May 31st.

Finished at 17:55

# LOG

### 19:00 - 19:25
1. Added functionality for production on Selenium Grid.

### 18:00 - 19:00 (extra time)
1. Transformed all the functions into a class.
2. Added the data from comments and votes numbers, media type and link.

### 17:05 - 17:45
1. Algorithm to scroll is proving much more difficult than anticipated. Stll stuck on it.
2. Managed to finish the algorithm to scroll and retrieve. Is getting at least the number of items requested on config.
3. Finished challenge. Couldn't gather more data from scraping because of time constrain.
4. Error with regards of items scraped. Is scraping more items than requested, still have to fix that.

### 16:38 - 17:05
1. Decided to focus on retrieving only 1 post and the increase complecity by adding a scrolling algorithm.
2. Saving succesfully one scroll from 9GAG. Missing scroll logic and more data from post. Will add in what is left of time.

### 16:10 - 16:38
1. Params file and config file done. Got stuck with absolute paths.
2. First webdriver working and loading website. Now will start working on algorithm to scroll and capture data.

### 15:52 - 16:10
1. Finished first fixture
2. Package built and running.
3. Test cases done.

### 15:45 - 15:52
1. I will focus on deliver on the assignment by doing the whole process first without much
detail and the add detail as I move forward. To manage to get to the objective and build on that.
2. With that in mind, I will build this as a python package with test cases and config variables
from a YAML file. Will output to JSON and will save initially only title and link post to the 9gag post.
3. Then I will focus on adding more scraping data.
4. Folder and project structure created.
